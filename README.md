<p>In this project, we create an app where people can track their productivity over a 12 week period.</p>

<h3>Some Features ✍🏼:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Set your main goals for the challenge.</li>
  <li>Create mini goals for each main goal.</li>
  <li>Each week has its own dashboard.</li>
  <li>Weekly planner, where you can create a todo list for every day of the week.</li>
  <li>A habit tracker, where you can track your daily habits.</li>
  <li>Set your top three goals for each week.</li>
  <li>See your weekly progress in charts: todos per day & habits per week.</li>
  <li>Review your week</li>
  <li>Change the colours of your dashboard</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup-local">Angular 12</a>, TypeScript, and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/install">SCSS</a>.</p>
